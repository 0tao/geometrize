WORK IN PROGRESS

[Geometrize](http://www.geometrize.co.uk/) is a desktop app that geometrizes images into geometric primitives. Download it [here](http://www.geometrize.co.uk/), or run the [web demo](http://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/) in your browser.

Also see the [gallery](http://gallery.geometrize.co.uk/), the [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/Geometrizer) and Geometrize [tweening demo](http://tweens.geometrize.co.uk/).

## Features

 * Recreate images as geometric primitives.
 * Comes with hundreds of images with pre-tuned settings.
 * Export geometrized images to SVG, PNG, JPG and animated GIF.
 * Export geometrized images as HTML5 canvas or WebGL webpages.
 * Export shape data as JSON for use in custom projects and creations.
 * Control the algorithm at the core of Geometrize with ChaiScript scripts.

## Usage

Basic usage is to simply open the app, select an image, pick your desired shape types, and hit start.

Video tutorials on getting the most out of Geometrize are posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9ogi_J4cFgcqLdpmPC7GdFV5ohJPEzN).

## Building

 * Download and install Qt 5.9.x or above (Geometrize is a Qt app written in C++11).
 * Install Python 3.x (the build process includes a few Python scripts for creating resource files).
 * Checkout this repository and all submodules, and build and run ''geometrize.pro''.
